New Installation
================

If you're reading this, you have already unarchived the latest version of the
Forum Runner add-on into your base forum directory.  It will have created a
'forumrunner' subdirectory where all the add-on files (including this one) are
located.

The next step is to log into the vBulletin Administrator Control Panel and
double click on the "Plugins & Products" menu on the left.  Then, click on the
"Manage Products" command.

At the bottom of the list, you will see "Add/Import Product".  Click this.

In the field "OR import the XML file from your server", enter the text
"./forumrunner/product-forumrunner.xml" (without the quotes) and make sure
that "Allow Overwrite" is set to "Yes".  Click "Import".

This installs the Forum Runner add-on completely and you can now go and verify
your forum through the Forum Manager located at http://www.forumrunner.com.

Upgrading an Existing Installation
==================================

Simply follow the exact same instructions as above.  Make sure you overwrite
all files in the 'forumrunner' subdirectory, and when you import the
product-forumrunner.xml file, make sure the "Allow Overwrite" is set to "Yes".

Forum Runner Settings
=====================

After importing the product-forumrunner.xml file, you can go to the vBulletin
Administrator Control Panel and tweak various Forum Runner settings.

Click on the menu item "vBulletin Options->vBulletin Options", then look for
"Forum Runner Settings" in the list on the right.  Double click this to bring
up the various Forum Runner settings.
